## Reflection

Working on the Sweat Strong Gym website has been a rewarding and eye-opening experience. At first, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of planning and detail that goes into building a professional, mobile-first site from scratch. Getting the folder structure and asset management right took longer than expected, but it really helped me understand the importance of organization in web projects.

One of the biggest challenges was making sure the site looked great and worked smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. I spent a lot of time testing different layouts and tweaking the CSS to get the gallery and navigation working responsively. Integrating accessibility features like `aria-labels` and ensuring all images had descriptive `alt` text made me much more aware of inclusive design.

I also learned a lot about using external libraries like Bootstrap and Font Awesome, and how to blend them with custom CSS for a unique look. Setting up deployment with GitHub Pages was new to me, but now I feel confident about putting a project live for others to see.

If I were to do this project again, I‚Äôd start the wireframing and content planning even earlier, and maybe try out a CSS preprocessor for better style management. Overall, I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve built and grateful for the feedback and support from my mentor, friends, and the Code Institute community.
